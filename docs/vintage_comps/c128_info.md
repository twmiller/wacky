# Commodore 128

## Summary

"The Commodore 128, also known as the C128, C-128, C= 128, is the last 8-bit home computer that
was commercially released by Commodore Business Machines (CBM). Introduced in January 1985 at
the CES in Las Vegas, it appeared three years after its predecessor, the bestselling Commodore 64. The C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64, with nearly full compatibility. The newer
machine has 128 KB of RAM in two 64 KB, and an 80-column color video output. It has a
redesigned case and keyboard. Also included is a Zilog Z80 CPU which allows the C128 to run CP/M, as
an alternative to the usual Commodore BASIC environment. The presence of the Z80 and the huge CP/M
software library it brings, coupled with the C64's software library, gives the C128 one of the broadest
ranges of available software among its competitors." - from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128)
